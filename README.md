# AB-testing-on-mobile-game
I conducted AB testing on a mobile game to see if moving the gate from level 30 to 40 has increased the average number of game sessions by n sessions. After removing outliers via IQR method and choosing n=3, I can conclude that increasing the gate from 30 to 40 will increase the average number of game sessions by n.
